# Stock Market Prediction and Forecasting with Stacked LSTM

## Overview
This project utilizes a stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict and forecast stock prices based on historical data. The model is trained on a dataset of historical stock prices, and the predictions are then evaluated against real market data.

## Features
- Stacked LSTM architecture for capturing complex patterns in time series data.
- Data preprocessing using Min-Max scaling for normalization.
- Training and evaluation scripts for model performance analysis.

## Dataset
The project uses the [NSE-TATAGLOBAL dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwitiderrick/stockprice/master/NSE-TATAGLOBAL.csv) for training and testing the LSTM model.

## Usage
1. Install the required dependencies using `requirements.txt`.
2. Run the preprocessing script to clean and normalize the data.
3. Train the LSTM model using the provided training script.
4. Evaluate the model's performance with the testing script.

## Results
Include visualizations or summary tables showcasing the model's predictions against actual stock prices. Highlight key performance metrics such as RMSE.

## Future Improvements
- Experiment with different hyperparameters for model tuning.
- Explore additional features for better prediction accuracy.
- Consider implementing more advanced architectures or ensemble methods.
